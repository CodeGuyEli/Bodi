# Developing

Hello! And thank you for your time & interest for looking through the tasks that this project currently needs help with!

There a several tasks that currently need help with. Including tasks for PHP, JavaScript & CSS / HTML developers. 

You can find more about these tasks in the [todo](.github/TO-DO.md), tasks are sorted by priority & language type (PHP, Javascript, CSS / HTML & General Tasks).

Each task has been assigned an issue, if you are willing to take on the task. Click the issue for the task & ask to be assigned to the issue - so nobody else is working on the same task at the same time. 
If nobody has already asked to be assigned to the task - you are more than welcome to start working on it after asking to being assigned to this issue.
