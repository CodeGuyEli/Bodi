# Developing

> Note: The main theme for Bodi relys on the <b>Estuary</b> design framework (A HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework that looks like the default Kodi theme) which is also a work in progress, and needs major improvements. If you are interested in how you can contribute to Estuary, see the repo [here](https://github.com/MarketingPipeline/Estuary) 


Hello! And thank you for your time & interest for looking through the tasks that this project currently needs help with!

There a several tasks that currently need help with. Including tasks for PHP, JavaScript & CSS / HTML developers. 

You can find more about these tasks in the [todo](.github/TO-DO.md), tasks are sorted by priority & language type (PHP, Javascript, CSS / HTML & general tasks).

Each task has been assigned an issue, if you are willing to take on the task. Click the issue for the task & ask to be assigned to the issue - so nobody else is working on the same task at the same time. 
If nobody has already asked to be assigned to the task - you are more than welcome to start working on it after asking to being assigned to this issue. 


To start developing this project, you can find the source code in the [src](https://github.com/MarketingPipeline/Bodi/src) folder.
