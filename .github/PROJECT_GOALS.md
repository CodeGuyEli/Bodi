## Project Goals

This project aims to re-create Kodi in more modern techonlogy. Allowing a community of more developers to develop plugins, themes & more. Ideally, there will be two versions
of <b>Bodi</b>. A completly static basic version that can be deployed to even GitHub Pages etc as well a server based version that includes a backend possibly via PHP, NodeJS etc...


### Static Version 

The goal is the static version will be able to connect to other <b>Bodi</b> server instances & play media from there, install (supported static) addons, import movies / media file paths etc via JSON.

### Server Version

The goal for the server based is to be able to deploy & run this on a web server if prefered or run / deploy locally. With the ability to share media libraries to static <b>Bodi</b> instances and more. 

> Notes: not saying PHP is the best route for this project, but if the server version is developed in PHP, a plugin could possibily be developed to auto-download / install Node.JS & etc to server to be able to expland the plugin options / development options.
