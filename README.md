## About Bodi

Bodi is a project with goals to become a modern multi-media management tool, heavily inspired by "Kodi". This project is currently built with HTML, JavaScript, CSS. Tho hopes to expand it's development community to (Node.JS, PHP & Python) developers. And hopes to provide one day, both a static version for simple usage and a server based version with more advanced usage.
